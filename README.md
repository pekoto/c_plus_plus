# C++ Notes

## Versions

* Classical C++: Pre-C++ 11 standard
* "Modern" C++: C++ 11 onwards (currently C++ 20, but althoughthat standard has been published,
most implementations are still C++ 17).

## Reminder

* Source code > compiler > object code (machine code) > linker > executable
* Object files: Windows: .obj, Mac/linux: .o
* Linker: links our code with other libraries
* Creates the executable program
